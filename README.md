# GitHub: sort by recently
Load this userscript in Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey, Violentmonkey, or any extension of this kind.

## How to install
Click the file named `userscript.user.js` (not the other one without the `.user.` in the name).<br>
Once opened, click the `Raw` button.<br>
At this point your extension will take control, and will ask you if you want to install it.

## What it does
It adds 2 links (named "(r)") to sort by "recently updated" (issues &amp; PR tabs)<br>

And in the GitHub page header<br>

On the page displaying all your Pull requests, or Issues, a new category ("Commenter") now appears.<br>
Clicking this button will display all the issues/pr in which you made a comment. They might not appear in the other categories.<br>
